Watch plants grow on the terminal

## TO DO

* Get networking going using [Boost](https://www.boost.org)
* Have basic terminal rendering

## Some Questions to Answer...

* Do we want peer-to-peer? or client-server communication (I think the client-server architecture is a lot more useful to learn... maybe we should do that)
* if we want client-server communication... how are we going to host this server? (it'd be cool to learn how to mantain a server)
